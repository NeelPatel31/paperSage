# paperSage: A RAG based Chatbot ðŸš€

## Your PDF Query Companion 
### Unlock the Knowledge in Your PDFs

**paperSage** is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based Question-Answering (QA) application that allows users to ask any questions from a PDF document. Built from scratch, paperSage leverages advanced embedding models to provide accurate and insightful answers from your documents.

### Features
- **Upload PDFs**: Easily upload your PDF documents.
- **Efficient Processing**: The application processes the entire PDF and notifies you once it's ready.
- **Ask Questions**: Query the content of your PDF and get instant answers.

### How to Use
1. **Upload the PDF**: Select and upload your PDF document.
2. **Wait for Processing**: The application will process the entire PDF. The time required is proportional to the number of pages in the PDF. Once processing is complete, you will be notified.
3. **Ask Questions**: Start asking any questions from the PDF and receive accurate answers.

### Note
The embedding model is running on CPU, so the processing time depends on the number of pages in the PDF.
